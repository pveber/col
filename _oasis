Description:
  This package provides a syntax extension for easier manipulation of flat records, objects or tuples and conversions from/to CSV files.
  . 
  Scientific data is often stored in the form of tables where each line 
  represents an object and columns are descriptors of this object (like in
  a spreadsheet). Col is a syntax extension which generates appropriate types 
  and functions from a statement describing a flat record, in order to
  make the manipulation of this sort of data easier. In particular, this is 
  convenient to send data to your favorite spreadsheet or plotting program.

  Features:
  - automatic definition of record, tuple and object types associated to a 
    flat record, as well as conversion functions between them
  - generation of serialization functions as tab-separated strings, 
    parsing/unparsing of TSV files.
